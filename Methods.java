// A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it
// You can insert values or parameters into methods, and they will only be executed when called. 
// They are also referred to as functions. The primary uses of methods in Java are:

        // It allows code reusability (define once and use multiple times).
       // You can break a complex program into smaller chunks of code.
      // It increases code readability.

/* The six components for declaring the methods are:
   1) Access Specifiers
   2) Return Type
   3) Method Name
   4) Parameter List
   5) Method Signature
