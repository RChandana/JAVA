/* A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
 The data, or variables, defined within a class are called instance variables. The code is contained within methods. 
 Collectively, the methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class.
 Variables defined within a class are called instance variables because each instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of these variables. 
 Thus, the data for one object is separate and unique from the data for another. 
 The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable. */

// The new operator dynamically allocates (that is, allocates at run time) memory for an object and returns a reference to it.
